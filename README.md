(a) Conventional downsampling and upsampling processes. SLVC is sliding local variance calculation, $4 \times$ is images with 4-fold downsampling followed by restoration to original size, where the processed texture images show differences and roughness compared to the pre-processed images. (b) Wavelet transform downsampling and upsampling processes, where the two texture images before and after processing exhibit extreme similarity.

(a) The overall framework of the proposed method. (b) The process of generating four low-resolution components from the input image through DWT downsampling and the process of upsampling back to a high-resolution image through IDWT. (c) The processing of two consecutive WFE modules. When the module is a DWFE, the feature maps will be concatenated with those from other nodes.

# 🚀 Train and Inference Guide for DWTFreqNet

This section outlines the steps to run inference using the DWTFreqNet model.

---

### 📝 Step 1: Prepare the Dataset

Download the open-source infrared small target detection datasets we used:
[NUDT-SIRST](https://github.com/YeRen123455/Infrared-Small-Target-Detection), [NUAA-SIRST](https://github.com/YimianDai/open-deepinfrared), and [IRSTD-1K](https://github.com/RuiZhang97/ISNet).

Specify the dataset you want to train on and the path where the dataset is placed:
```python
parser.add_argument("--dataset_names", default=['NUDT-SIRST'], type=list)
parser.add_argument("--dataset_dir", default=r'../Dataset')
```

---

### ▶️ Step 2: Run Train

Run the train script:

```bash
python train.py
```

The output results will be saved to the `./log/` directory.

---

### ▶️ Step 3: Run Test

Run the test script:

```bash
python test.py
```
